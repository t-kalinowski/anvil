Package website: [release](https://r-xla.github.io/anvil/) \|
[dev](https://r-xla.github.io/anvil/dev/)

Composable code transformation framework for R, allowing you to run
numerical programs at the speed of light. It currently implements JIT
compilation for very fast execution and backward-mode automatic
differentiation. Programs can run on various hardware backends,
including CPU and GPU.

## Installation

{anvil} can be installed from GitHub or
[r-universe](https://r-xla.r-universe.dev/builds). Prebuilt [Docker
images](https://github.com/r-xla/docker) are also available. See the
[Installation](https://r-xla.github.io/anvil/articles/installation.html)
vignette for detailed instructions.

## Quick Start

Below, we create a standard R function. We cannot directly call this
function, but first need to wrap it in a
[`jit()`](https://r-xla.github.io/anvil/dev/reference/jit.md) call. If
the resulting function is then called on `AnvilTensor`s – the primary
data type in {anvil} – it will be JIT compiled and subsequently
executed.

``` r
library(anvil)
f <- function(a, b, x) {
  a * x + b
}
f_jit <- jit(f)

a <- nv_scalar(1.0, "f32")
b <- nv_scalar(-2.0, "f32")
x <- nv_scalar(3.0, "f32")

f_jit(a, b, x)
#> AnvilTensor
#>  1
#> [ CPUf32{} ]
```

Through automatic differentiation, we can also obtain the gradient of
the above function.

``` r
g_jit <- jit(gradient(f, wrt = c("a", "b")))
g_jit(a, b, x)
#> $a
#> AnvilTensor
#>  3
#> [ CPUf32{} ] 
#> 
#> $b
#> AnvilTensor
#>  1
#> [ CPUf32{} ]
```

## Main Features

- Automatic Differentiation:
  - Gradients for functions with scalar outputs are supported.
- Fast:
  - Code is JIT compiled into a single kernel.
  - Runs on different hardware backends, including CPU and GPU.
- Extendable:
  - It is possible to add new primitives, transformations, and (with
    some effort) new backends.
  - The package is written almost entirely in R.

## When to use this package?

While {anvil} allows to run certain types of programs extremely fast, it
only applies to a certain category of problems. Specifically, it is
suitable for numerical algorithms, such as optimizing bayesian models,
training neural networks or more generally numerical optimization.
Another restriction is that {anvil} needs to re-compile the code for
each new unique input shape. This has the advantage, that the compiler
can make memory optimizations, but the compilation overhead might be a
problem for fast running programs.
