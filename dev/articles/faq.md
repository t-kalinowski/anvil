## How do I control the number of threads used by XLA?

XLA (the compiler backend used by `anvil`) may use multiple CPU threads
for parallelism. On shared systems such as HPC clusters, it is often
necessary to restrict which cores a process can use.

The recommended approach is to control thread affinity **from outside
the process**, using OS-level tools. On Linux, `taskset` is the most
common option:

``` bash
# Pin the R process to cores 0-3
taskset -c 0-3 Rscript my_script.R
```
