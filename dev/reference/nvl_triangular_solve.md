# Primitive Triangular Solve

Solves a system of linear equations with a triangular coefficient
matrix. When `left_side` is `TRUE`, solves `op(a) %*% x = b` for `x`.
When `left_side` is `FALSE`, solves `x %*% op(a) = b` for `x`.
Dimensions before the last two are batch dimensions and must match
between `a` and `b` (no broadcasting). Here `op` is `A` or `A^T`
depending on `transpose_a`.

## Usage

``` r
nvl_triangular_solve(a, b, left_side, lower, unit_diagonal, transpose_a)
```

## Arguments

- a:

  ([`tensorish`](https://r-xla.github.io/anvil/dev/reference/tensorish.md))  
  Triangular coefficient matrix of data type floating-point with at
  least 2 dimensions. The last two dimensions must be equal (square
  matrix); any leading dimensions are batch dimensions.

- b:

  ([`tensorish`](https://r-xla.github.io/anvil/dev/reference/tensorish.md))  
  Right-hand side tensor. Must have the same data type, rank, and batch
  dimensions as `a`.

- left_side:

  (`logical(1)`)  
  If `TRUE`, solve `op(a) %*% x = b`. If `FALSE`, solve
  `x %*% op(a) = b`.

- lower:

  (`logical(1)`)  
  If `TRUE`, `a` is lower triangular. If `FALSE`, `a` is upper
  triangular.

- unit_diagonal:

  (`logical(1)`)  
  If `TRUE`, assume diagonal elements of `a` are 1.

- transpose_a:

  (`character(1)`)  
  One of `"NO_TRANSPOSE"`, `"TRANSPOSE"`, or `"ADJOINT"`.

## Value

[`tensorish`](https://r-xla.github.io/anvil/dev/reference/tensorish.md)  
Has the same shape and data type as `b`. It is ambiguous if both `a` and
`b` are ambiguous.

## Examples

``` r
jit_eval({
  # Solve L %*% x = b where L is lower triangular
  L <- nv_tensor(matrix(c(2, 0, 1, 3), nrow = 2), dtype = "f32")
  b <- nv_tensor(matrix(c(4, 3), nrow = 2), dtype = "f32")
  nvl_triangular_solve(L, b,
    left_side = TRUE, lower = TRUE,
    unit_diagonal = FALSE, transpose_a = "NO_TRANSPOSE"
  )
})
