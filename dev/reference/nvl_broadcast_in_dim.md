# Primitive Broadcast

Broadcasts a tensor to a new shape by replicating the data along new or
size-1 dimensions.

## Usage

``` r
nvl_broadcast_in_dim(operand, shape, broadcast_dimensions)
```

## Arguments

- operand:

  ([`tensorish`](https://r-xla.github.io/anvil/dev/reference/tensorish.md))  
  Tensorish value of any data type.

- shape:

  ([`integer()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/integer.html))  
  Target shape. Each mapped dimension must either match the
  corresponding operand dimension or the operand dimension must be 1.

- broadcast_dimensions:

  ([`integer()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/integer.html))  
  Maps each dimension of `operand` to a dimension of the output. Must
  have length equal to the number of dimensions of `operand`.

## Value

[`tensorish`](https://r-xla.github.io/anvil/dev/reference/tensorish.md)  
Has the same data type as the input and the given `shape`. It is
ambiguous if the input is ambiguous.

## Implemented Rules

- `stablehlo`

- `backward`

  x <- nv_tensor(c(1, 2, 3))
  nvl_broadcast_in_dim(x, shape = c(2, 3), broadcast_dimensions = 2L)
})
